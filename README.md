# Trends-and-Determinants-in-Cardiovascular-Disease
BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
Analyzed WHO MONICA (Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) dataset to find demographic and physiological indicators associated with the outcome of mortality from cardiovascular disease.

Performed univariate and multivariate analysis using chi-square test to find the strategically significant variables and plotted graphs to visualize the output that was generated.

Performed logistic regression to find the strength of the association between the predictor factors such as high cholesterol, smoking status, high blood pressure and previous myocardial infraction to predict the outcome (dead or live).

TOP FINDINGS:
Hospitalization status was the strongest predictor of cardiovascular mortality.
KNN method outperforms the multivariable logistic regression model, which produced McFadden R2 values in the moderate range of 55-65%.
The Decision Tree method produced the most accurate predictions of the outcome dead for men (77%), wheareas Random Forest produced the most accurate predicitons of the outcome dead for women (78.6%).
